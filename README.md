&emsp;Some demo programs written while learning the OS(operating system).

- [fork.c](https://github.com/NingNing0111/OSStudy/blob/master/unixStudy/fork.c) : A demo that uses the `fork()` to create a process in C language.
- [execvp.c](https://github.com/NingNing0111/OSStudy/blob/master/unixStudy/execvp.c): A demo that uses the `execvp()` to execute other programs in the current process.
- [myshell.c](https://github.com/NingNing0111/OSStudy/blob/master/unixStudy/myshell.c): A demo that implements **Shell** using `fork()` and `execvp()`.
- [consumer_producer.c](https://github.com/NingNing0111/OSStudy/blob/master/unixStudy/consumer_producer.c): A demo for explaining the producer-consumer problem.
- [peterson.c](https://github.com/NingNing0111/OSStudy/blob/master/unixStudy/peterson.c): A demo that implements **Peterson Algorithm**.
